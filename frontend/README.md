# **Frontend**

## Overview
This frontend lets you create, visualize, and test automated decision policies with an intuitive flow builder. Define policies, connect logic blocks, and test decisions effortlesslyâ€”all in a sleek and interactive interface.

Simple, fast, and (mostly) foolproof. 

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- ReactFlow

## Navigating the Project

Youâ€™ve got three major pages to play with:

### **1. /policies (which you'll land on by default, like magic)**

![Policies List](../assets/policies_list.png)

Here, youâ€™ll see all the policies youâ€™ve created (or none, if youâ€™re just starting out). Click on any policy, andâ€”voilÃ â€”a new tab opens, taking you straight to its decision flow.

Want to create a new policy? Hit that shiny blue button at the top, give it a meaningful name (because clean code, right?), and save it. Thatâ€™s it. Youâ€™re officially a policymaker.

### **2. /policy/:id**

![Policy Flow](../assets/policy_flow.png)

Welcome to the policy flow builder. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:

- The **Start Block** is always there, holding your policyâ€™s name like a proud badge. You canâ€™t delete it. Deal with it.
- From the Start Block, you get exactly **one** connection. No chaos allowed.
- **Condition Blocks** let you define conditions and set paths based on whether they are met. You get **two** connections here: one for when the condition matches and another for when it doesnâ€™t. Chain them together, go wild (but not too wild).
- **Decision Blocks** represent the final outcome of a flow. Once a path reaches this block, a decision is made. Done and dusted.

At the top of your screen, youâ€™ll see a toolbar:
- **The Plus (+) Icon** â†’ Add Condition or Decision Blocks (because one is never enough).
- **The Save (ðŸ’¾) Icon** â†’ Saves your masterpiece. Hit it often.

If your flow has inconsistenciesâ€”like loops, missing connections, or other chaotic mishapsâ€”the system will let you know. No judgment, mistakes happen.

### **3. /decision**

![Decision](../assets/decision.png)

You built a policy. You designed its flow. Now what? Time to test it.

Head over to **/decision**. Youâ€™ll find a dropdown listing all your policies. Pick one, and youâ€™ll see a form with all the variables you set up earlier. Fill them out, hit submit, and watch your decision engine work its magic.

![Decision Result](../assets/decision_result.png)

Congratulations, big champ. You just built an automated decision system. Go flex.
